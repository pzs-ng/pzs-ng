AUTHORS NOTES AND ADVICES:
--------------------------
  I've used a lot of time to generate docs and commenting the scripts and
  their variables. Please do not skim these documents - read them. It got a
  lot of important information, including extensive instructions on debugging
  (should that be required.)
  Also *read* the comments inside the script. Especially if you change some default
  variables. The script is meant to work almost out-of-the-box, so very few changes
  is indeed necessary.
  A big *THANX* to kantele for pointing out and helping me use post_check instead
  of zs-c's accept_script. Also thanx to the people in #psxc for helping to debug
  the script - I could not have done this without you.

  Users of this script upgrading to v2.2 or later really should focus on point
  4. under QUICK SETUP below. There has been a fundamental change on how to
  call this script.

  Below are a few example setups. Some people will find the config huge, and
  be scared off. Others will try to tweak every setting they find by default,
  needed or not. Please, just check the examples under "DETAILED SETUP" and find
  one that (sort-of) matches your setup. Then follow the steps. Don't do more,
  don't skip a step. Once it works, you're free to explore the different options
  and tweak to your hearts content.



DESCRIPTION:
------------
This script will (like a great deal of other scripts) read the imdb-url in a
.nfo and paste parts of what it finds in the IRC channel. So, what's different
with this script?
Well, unlike the others, this do not require tcl or perl in able to work, but it
do support some external scripts to accomodate for pre-support and speedier irc-
channel output. In it's basic form, it's a single, small(?) file.

- It will output imdb information in irc-channel(s).
- It supports pre/group/private dirs and pre'ing of releases.
- It supports output of imdb info into a file inside the releasedir, making it
  possible to auto-view on entering the dir.
- It can generate an Internet Explorer .url or .html, for easy click-n-view.
- Supports links to international ( German, Italian, French and others)
  versions of imdb.com - will show the US data however.
- Very stable - will extract a valid imdb link from almost any .nfo (unlike
  others I've seen)
- Support for addons - three example addons is currently included. One which create
  symlinks to releases based on different information (genre, year, top250, score,
  title, releasedate), an auto-nuker/nukewarner, and a re-formatter of the .imdb
  file put in the release-dir.
- Rescan ability - included is an advanced rescan feature.
- Sanity-check - this will help you set things up, and check your environment when
  doing upgrades.
- Easy upgrading - the configs are in separate files, so an upgrade can be done
  without the need to reconfigure. The CHANGELOG, UPGRADING and diff-files (found
  in the diff/ directory) will help you, depending on the level you know *nix.
- Versatile - run the script from crontab or a sitebot, or totally within glftpd's
  chroot'ed environment.
- An extra feature is the ability to extract release dates of releases from
  .nfo-files. This is so far only a BETA feature, but should work with 85-90
   percent of all .nfo files. This feature is currently *ENABLED* by default.
- Do !imdb in your channel and get info on a movie. It is also possible to /msg
   the bot and have the results pasted in private.
- Extensive formatting options - you are virtually free to make the output of
   your choice.

All features are configurable to a certain extent, or possible to turn
off altogether.



NEEDED BINARIES:
----------------
There is a few binaries that needs to be availible in your path, and in glftpd's
/bin directory. Running psxc-imdb-sanity.sh (found in the extras/ directory) will
check to see if you have them all. It will also check to see if you have all the
needed libs the bins need, and copy them if needed.



QUICK SETUP:
------------
The following steps is needed to set things up. Step 4 and 6 have more than one
way to do things - choose the one (a, b or c) that fits your setup.

THE INSTALLER will help you do step 1, 2, 3, and parts of 6b. It is NO SUBSTITUTE
for following this guide - in fact, it is encouraged to go over all of these
steps to make sure the installer did the right thing. It will help you set up
paths etc, which can be tediuos.

1.  Edit psxc-imdb.sh and psxc-imdb.conf.

2.  Copy psxc-imdb.sh and psxc-imdb.conf:

     cp psxc-imdb.sh /glftpd/bin && chmod +x /glftpd/bin/psxc-imdb.sh
     cp psxc-imdb.conf /glftpd/etc && chmod +r /glftpd/etc/psxc-imdb.conf

3.  Run psxc-imdb-sanity.sh - this will set up a few files and check your setup.

4.  Select *ONE* of the following options (a, b or c). Option b. is the
     preferred method if you zipscript-c (project-zs).
 a. THE FOLLOWING IS DISCOURAGED. USE METHOD 4b or 4c INSTEAD.
    Add/edit the following in zipscript-c's zsconfig.h (Project-ZS):

     #define enable_accept_script    TRUE
     #define accept_script           "/bin/psxc-imdb.sh"

    (then "./configure && make && make install" or whatever)

 b. Add/edit the following in zsconfig.h

     #define enable_nfo_script       TRUE
     #define nfo_script              "/bin/psxc-imdb.sh"

    (then "./configure && make && make install" or whatever)

 c. Add the following to glftpd.conf:

    post_check /bin/psxc-imdb.sh /site/SECTION/*/*/*.*.*.*.*.*.nfo
    post_check /bin/psxc-imdb.sh /site/SECTION/*/*/*.*.*.*.*.nfo
    post_check /bin/psxc-imdb.sh /site/SECTION/*/*/*.*.*.*.nfo
    post_check /bin/psxc-imdb.sh /site/SECTION/*/*/*.*.*.nfo
    post_check /bin/psxc-imdb.sh /site/SECTION/*/*/*.*.nfo
    post_check /bin/psxc-imdb.sh /site/SECTION/*/*.*.*.*.*.*.nfo
    post_check /bin/psxc-imdb.sh /site/SECTION/*/*.*.*.*.*.nfo
    post_check /bin/psxc-imdb.sh /site/SECTION/*/*.*.*.*.nfo
    post_check /bin/psxc-imdb.sh /site/SECTION/*/*.*.*.nfo
    post_check /bin/psxc-imdb.sh /site/SECTION/*/*.*.nfo
    post_check /bin/psxc-imdb.sh /site/SECTION/*/*.nfo

    This should be done before any other post_check lines
    in glftpd.conf - it's first match wins, and we want
    .nfo files to be handled by the script, not by the
    generic zipscript. So do not remove any other
    post_check lines you find.
    Replace SECTION with the names of your sections -
    if you have several sections, put several post_check
    lines in glftpd.conf
    Why so many? It seems there is a feature/bug in glftpd,
    which affect how glftpd read the path. I seems if that
    if it finds a dot (.) and the rest of the line do not
    match, it just skips that post_check line entirely, and
    goes down to the next one. The above should be sufficient
    (very few nfo's have more than 6 dots, but they do exist),
    but if you are uncertain, feel free to add more. 
    A small tip - If you're feeling lazy/have many sections,
    change "SECTION" to "*" ;)

5.  Add/edit the following in glftpd.conf:

     show_diz        .message .imdb .date

    (the .imdb/.date part being what's added)
    This step is not required for the script to work, but it is recommended
     if you wish to let people see the content of the .imdb and .date files.

6.  Select *ONE* of the following options (a, b or c). Option b. is the
     preferred method if you use a bot.
 a. THE FOLLOWING IS DISCOURAGED. USE METHOD 6b INSTEAD.
     Add the following to your crontab (slow):

     * * * * * /glftpd/bin/psxc-imdb.sh

 b. Set up psxc-imdb.tcl.
    Add the following in your eggdrop.conf:

    source pzs-ng/plugins/psxc-imdb.tcl

 c. THE FOLLOWING IS DISCOURAGED. USE METHOD 6b INSTEAD.
    Edit psxc-imdb.conf and set RUNCONTINOUS to "yes".
    This will probalby only work if you run everything chrooted.



DETAILED SETUP:
---------------

The following is 4 examples of setups. Please read them all, and find out
what is closest to your setup.

1. TYPICAL.
..........
   Your site has an irc-channel, and you use a bot to announce new releases
   etc. You use zipscript-c, aka Project-ZS, and the included botscript. You
   have no preing on your site. You yourself do not know tcl all that well,
   or how the botscript actually work, so you have not edited more in
   dZSbot.tcl than you actually need. You just wish to set things up quick.

   Do step 1 (see below as well), 2, 3, 4b and 5 as described above.

   In psxc-imdb.conf, verify that GLROOT is correct, set KEEPURLS to 0. Leave
   the rest for now.

   In psxc-imdb.tcl, verify that psxc(IMDBSCRIPT) and psxc(IMDBCHANNEL)
   are correct. Leave the rest for now.

   Then add the tcl and zpt:

     1. Copy the tcl files to your eggdrop's scripts-dir:
          cp *.tcl *.zpt /glftpd/sitebot/pzs-ng/plugins/
     
     2. Add the following in your eggdrop.conf:
          source pzs-ng/plugins/psxc-imdb.tcl
     
     3. Edit the new tcl files (yes, both. At least check to see if the
        variables are okay for your setup).
     
     4. Restart the bot.

   Things should now Just Work. When you have verified that your setup is
   okay, change KEEPURLS back to 10.

2. L33T
.......
   Your site has one or more irc channels. You use a bot to announce new
   releases etc. You use zipscript-c, aka Project-ZS, and the included
   botscript. You pre movies on your site. You may or may not know tcl, but
   you are very familiar with the settings in dZSbot.tcl. Adding new stuff
   there or editing that file should not pose a problem.

   Do step 1 (see below as well), 2, 3, 4b and 5 as described above.

   In psxc-imdb.conf, verify that GLROOT is correct, set KEEPURLS to 0.
   Change TRIGGER to "IMDB:", verify that your affil dir(s) are listed in
   BOTEXEMPT. Verify that your prescript logs to the path listed in
   GLPRELOG, and that the PRETRIGGER is correct. Also look over the rest
   of the pre-settings. Change LOGFORMAT to "SPECIAL".

   In psxc-imdb.tcl, verify that psxc(IMDBSCRIPT), psxc(IMDBCHANNEL),
   psxc(PRELOG) and psxc(PRESCRIPT) are correct. Change psxc(USEPRE) to
   "YES".

   Read the doc named README.use.of.special.format, and change dZSbot.tcl
   accordingly to your wishes.

   Add the tcl and zpt:

     1. Copy the tcl files to your eggdrop's scripts-dir:
          cp *.tcl *.zpt /glftpd/sitebot/pzs-ng/plugins/
     
     2. Add the following in your eggdrop.conf:
          source pzs-ng/plugins/psxc-imdb.tcl
     
     3. Edit the new tcl files (yes, both. At least check to see if the
        variables are okay for your setup).
     
     4. Restart the bot.

   Test your setup. When you are satisfied everything is okay, change
   KEEPURLS back to 10.

3. OUTSIDER
...........
   Your site has one or more irc channels. You use a bot to announce new
   releases etc. You do not use dZSbot.tcl found in zipscript-c/Project-ZS.
   You may or may not pre movies on your site. You may or may not know tcl,
   but you are used to changing your bot's config. However, for some reason,
   you do not wish to use glftpd.log to log movie-info.

   Do step 1 (see below as well), 2, 3, 4b and 5 as described above.

   In psxc-imdb.conf, verify that GLROOT is correct, set KEEPURLS to 0.
   Verify that your affil dir(s) are listed in BOTEXEMPT. Verify that your
   prescript (if you pre on the site) logs to the path listed in GLPRELOG,
   and that the PRETRIGGER is correct. Also look over the rest of the
   pre-settings. Change GLLOG to your alternative logfile.

   In psxc-imdb-bot.tcl, verify that psxc(IMDBSCRIPT), psxc(IMDBCHANNEL),
   psxc(PRELOG) and psxc(PRESCRIPT) are correct. Change psxc(USEPRE) and
   psxc(USEFULL) to "YES". Change psxc(IMDBMOVIE) to what you set GLLOG
   to in psxc-imdb.conf.

   Add the tcl's:

     1. Copy the tcl files to your eggdrop's scripts-dir:
          cp old/*.tcl /glftpd/sitebot/scripts/
     
     2. Add the following in your eggdrop.conf:
          source scripts/psxc-imdb-bot.tcl
     
     3. Edit the new tcl files (yes, both. At least check to see if the
        variables are okay for your setup).
     
     4. Restart the bot.

   There should be no need to change your botscript.

   Test your setup, including running psxc-imdb-sanity.sh again. When you
   are satisfied everything is okay, change KEEPURLS back to 10.

4. SMALL
........
   You are relatively new to glftpd, or have just a small site. You have
   no special channel on irc, and do not use a bot at all.
   
   Do step 1 (see below as well), 2, 3, 4b, 5 and 6a as described above.

   In psxc-imdb.conf, verify that GLROOT is correct, set USEBOT to "". Leave
   the rest for now.

   Test your setup.


VERBOSE SETUP:
--------------

Here follows a generic explanation on how you can set things up, if the above
did not go into enough details, or you did not find a setting matching yours.

ADDING SITEBOT SUPPORT (OPTIONAL):
..................................
   Bot support is always nice. There are many ways to include bot support, and
   the default is probably the easiest for most people. I will not go into detail
   about this because there are way to many botscripts out there, but I will
   try to describe the procedure in a more or less generic way.
   
   The normal approach is to use a trigger for output. The default way (using
   the UPDATE: trigger) will be sufficient for most I believe.
   
   For those with skills on their bot it's possible to change the trigger and
   add a special one for imdb output. Info on how this should be done is described
   a bit further down.
   DO NOT CHANGE THE TRIGGER TO IMDB: (or whatever) unless you know what you are
   doing!
   
   If you prefer to log imdb-info to a special file, or are unable to use the
   default glftpd.log for some reason, you should use the "full" feature.
   Instructions for usage are described further down.

SETTING UP THE BOT (OPTIONAL):
..............................
   If you wish to use the included tcl-files in your bot, to either replace the
   crontab entry, add support for pre'ing, use the script as the main output of
   imdb-info, or any combination of the 3, you must do the following:
   
   1. Copy the tcl and zpt files to your eggdrop's scripts-dir:
        cp *.tcl *.zpt /glftpd/sitebot/pzs-ng/plugins/
   
   2. Add the following in your eggdrop.conf:
        source pzs-ng/plugins//psxc-imdb.tcl
   
   3. Edit the new tcl files (yes, both. At least check to see if the variables are
      okay for your setup).
   
   4. Restart the bot.

ADDING PRE SUPPORT (OPTIONAL):
..............................
   Normally when files are uploaded in group-dirs, there is no announce in channel
   about the movie (would rather spoil the pre, now, wouldn't it? ;) It will
   however make the DOTIMDB (if DOTIMDB is used).
   When the release is finally PRE'd, there's no IMDb info announced in channel.
   So, how to fix that?
   
   psxc-imdb.sh is able to handle this as well, but special care must be taken to
   make it work. Since you're most likely using a bot already, I'll not get into
   other methods of usage (cscript, crontab, modified prescript) beside the normal
   approach, which is to add the support from within the bot.
   Whatever prescript you use, and to whatever file this logs, the included support
   for pre'ing of imdb-releases *require* the path to the DESTINATION of the pre.
   Various methods for grabbing this info is included, and is fairly documented within
   the config.
   
   Setting it up:
   
   If you've already used psxc-imdb-sanity.sh, the following is not necessary - the
   script will already have done this for you:
   
     cd /glftpd/bin
     ln -s psxc-imdb.sh psxc-imdb-pre.sh
   
   This will make a symlink of the original script. (I may change this in the future,
   but for now this is the way.) The script checks under what name it is run, and if
   it is named psxc-imdb-pre.sh it will execute a special part of itself. The name
   of the -pre.sh can be whatever you wish - it's editable in the config. You may even
   use a separate script if you like.
   If a file or symlink already exists, psxc-imdb-sanity.sh will not delete/replace
   it, so it is safe if you decide to use a different imdb-pre script than psxc-imdb.sh.
   Then edit psxc-imdb.conf and psxc-imdb.tcl to add pre support.

ADDING YOUR OWN FORMATTED BOT-OUTPUT (OPTIONAL):
................................................
   Someone in the know often like to personalize everything on their site. This
   is, ofcourse, possible, and quite easy in most cases. You have basically 4
   options - you can use the default output which paste a pre-formatted output
   in your chan. You can choose to use the oneline option, which, instead of
   putting several lines in your channel, outputs one line with specific,
   pre-formatted output. Your 3rd and 4th option involves the LOGFORMAT
   variable. You can either format your output from within the script itself,
   or choose to export all variables so that the bot may handle the format.
   There should be enough instructions within the config file to see how to
   set up the internal formatting, and the external formatting can be explored
   in the file "README.use.of.special.format".

USING THE "FULL" FEATURE (OPTIONAL):
....................................
   At times your default botscript cannot handle the imdb output. Or you might decide
   to use a different logfile for imdb output for the bot(s) for different reasons.
   For whatever reason, the included .tcl's can handle the output generated by the
   script. This is known as "full" mode. It is quite easy to set up - just edit the
   described variables in the psxc-imdb.tcl, and make sure you are not using
   glftpd.log as the logfile.
   Using "full" mode does not require you to run everything through the bot-addon.
   It is quite possible to have just the !imdb output handled by the bot-addon,
   and the main output taken care of by your main botscript.
   Should all other options fail for you, the "full" mode might be your solution.



ADDONS:
-------
Addons can be used to a lot of things. Included in addons/ is three scripts (for now)
which will enhance your site in different ways.

psxc-imdb-nuker.sh    - This script can be used to either nuke a release outright, log
                        the offending release to a logfile, or send out a nukewarning
                        in your irc-channel. What qualifies as a nuke is up to you.

psxc-symlink-maker.sh - Sort your movie-releases based on a number of things, from
                        type of movie (genre) to ranking on imdb (top250). Symlinks
                        will be created in special dirs.
                        
psxc-dotimdb.pl       - This perl addon will reformat your .imdb output. See
                        README.psxc-imdb-dotimdb for example outputs.

With the example script found in addons/ you should be able to write your own addon,
if you're a scripter. The variables extracted from iMDB is passed along to the addon,
making it easy to use the variables in any way you see fit.



EXTRAS:
-------
In the extras folder you'll find a few goodies you probably would like to use.
psxc-imdb-rescan.sh - this is a site script used to rescan a dir, or a whole
                      section.
psxc-imdb-sanity.sh - you have probably used this already - it sets up and
                      verifies your environment and settings.
psxc-imdb-parser.sh - not a real script - it just shows how you can grab the
                      variables sent from psxc-imdb.sh to the addons.
psxc-imdb-find.sh   - This files is needed for your bot to answer to
                      !imdb calls. There is a readme (README.psxc-imdb-find) - I
                      suggest you read it before setting this up.



OTHER:
------
makeclean.sh        - just a small script removing empty lines and comments from
                      files, and output the content to screen (STDOUT).
makediff.sh         - this is what I use to make the patch-files under diff/.
psxc-depcheck       - This will check library dependencies in glftpd's bin dir
                      and copy the missing libs to glftpd's chroot. A similar
                      feature is included in psxc-imdb-sanity.sh.
psxc-zs-c-patches   - A patch for DarkOne's Project-ZS which will execute a
                      script on .nfo uploads.
xl-genrefind        - A bot-addon which searches .imdb files and outputs what
                      it finds to the user. This script is done by xoLax.
dZS-patch           - A blurb about rehashing bots, and the effect of it.



HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
The script (psxc-imdb.sh) is actually 3 scripts in one - one to grab and log
the url and path of the release, the second to check for imdb info when someone
does a pre, and the third to do all the hard work - getting imdb info and do
the logging.

So, why 3 parts?
When the first part is run, IMDB url and path is extracted and put in a logfile,
and an empty .imdb, .date, .url/.html and/or a .imdbinfoname is created in
(normally) the same folder as the .nfo. zipscript-c, if you choose to use it to
call psxc-imdb.sh, cannot handle any more. And you really do not wish to do more
at that time either. If the one uploading the .nfo has to wait for the imdb info
to be looked up and parsed, (s)he would probably upload the nfo last, or else (s)he
is likely to loose the race. There is also a chance of a timeout. So the idea
is to do things quick, and let the racer upload files instead of sitting idle
waiting.

The same can be said when a person pre a release, though the same issue with the
race being lost does not qualify :) Instead it will just be annoying.

When run from crontab, from a bot, or, heaven forbid, while uploading the nfo
(delay, as mentioned above) it will read the log it created earlier, look the
imdb-url up, and parse stuff into the .imdb and glftpd.log and any other files.
It will also call up any addons you've selected, sending the variables to them.



KNOWN BUGS:
-----------
None as far as I know. I have not tested it extensively on international movies,
and it may fail on movies using chars not in the ASCII-table. If you find a movie
it fails on, or a .info it cannot extract the url, please let me know.
