                          - Changed the url-extracting routine again.
                          - Removed lynx quality control - it did not work as
                             is was intended.
                          - Added sorting by imdb top 250 in the symlink-addon.
- v2.0k - Nov. 06th, 2003 - Fixed a number of bugs in psxc-symlimk-maker.sh.
                          - Added several better ways to control symlinks in
                             the symlink-addon, and some other enhancements.
                          - Fixed an issue with special years.
                          - Added a "quality control" for lynx - this should help
                             keep those strange lookups from appearing.
                          - Added a new addon script - psxc-imdb-nuker.sh. This will
                             autonuke releases based on several criterias.
                          - Added support for several addons (EXTERNALSCRIPTNAME).
                          - Changed psxc-imdb-parser.sh to only grab variables - the
                             examples in the addons/ directory should suffice.
- v2.0j - Nov. 03rd, 2003 - Added 'pwd' as a dependency in psxc-imdb-sanity.sh.
                          - Fixed some issues with the execution of external scripts.
                          - Fixed a couple of issues with RELAXEDURLS level 3 and 4.
                          - Added an example external script in /addons. This will
                             create symbolic links based on score, genre, year and/or
                             title. It will also clean up dead symlinks automagically.
- v2.0i - Oct. 29th, 2003 - Improved the routine for finding imdb info. You can now
                             select the level of strictness of what is considered a
                             valid imdb url/id.
                          - Fixed a problem with stale pid's - it will now do a ps
                             and make sure the pid in the pidfile is valid.
                          - Added better control over where to scan for imdb urls.
                          - Made sure no .date file is created unless some date info
                             is found.
                          - Added support for international imdb urls in the output.
- v2.0h - Oct. 24th, 2003 - The pre'ing of releases didn't work correctly - a minor
                             glitch in the script caused the wrong path to be used.
                          - Fixed a small issue with pre'ing and using the number
                            '0' in KEEPURLS (mostly used with debugging). Thanx kiji
                            for finding it.
                          - Fixed another issue with pre'ing - this time in the bot's
                             partyline (there was a mv error displayed).
                          - Fixed an issue with some imdb urls.
                          - Added a new config option which will allow the script to
                             search for more generic imdb urls. I need feedback on
                             this.
- v2.0g - Aug. 29th, 2003 - Ooops! Seems I forgot to fully check the script after the
                             change. New formattet urls did not work. Now both old
                             and new urls resolve okay.
- v2.0f - Aug. 28th, 2003 - The Internet Movie Database (imdb) changed the structure
                             of their web. So I changed the script.
                          - various bugfixes.
                          - psxc-imdb-sanity.sh now checks for /bin/bash outside
                             /glftpd as well (yes, you need it in /bin)
- v2.0e - Aug. 14th, 2003 - Fixed a bug on the handling of certification if you used
                             the "special" feature.
                          - Removed the useless variable INFOSPACE, and changed the
                             variable INFOVALID to reflect the change.
                          - Fixed a bug with the runtime variable in the bot, if you
                             used the "special" feature.
                          - Added a feature to show the person starring in the lead
                             role of the movie.
                          - Various bugfixes with the new file/dir creation.
- v2.0d - Aug. 09th, 2003 - Fixed a bug with the selection of Tagline and Plot.
                             Even if you selected both, only Plot was shown.
                          - Added %imdbdirname to the list of variables availible
                             to bot and external script.
                          - Fixed it so that if you select the "special" logformat,
                             you do not need to bother with BOTONELINE, TAGPLOT and
                             BOTHEAD - they will be set correctly automatically.
                          - Changed the name of the variable DOTIMDBPROG to
                             EXTERNALSCRIPTNAME to better show what it is. You no
                             longer need to select whether to create a .imdb or use
                             an external shell-script - both are possible.
                          - Added a feature to make a dir/file within the releasedir
                             with some imdb variables in the name.
                          - Did some internal cleanup.
                          - Fixed a bug with the creation of .url files. The file
                             created was not a valid url file.
- v2.0c - Aug. 06th, 2003 - Some bugs introduced in v2.0b found and fixed.
                          - Better handling of old cruft in the pidfile.
                          - Put the tcl-config in a separate file.
                          - Fixed a bug in the tcl which could lead to delayed
                             output.
                          - Edited the imdb-tcl-addon.txt to help ppl understand
                             the options better.
                          - Moved the check for files out of the main script into
                             a "sanity" script called psxc-imdb-sanity.sh.
                          - Added the sanity script for creating/checking the
                            needed files.

- v2.0b - Aug. 03rd, 2003 - By request I added a few more options for external
                             scripts. People formatting their bot-output are the
                             ones gaining most on this. People using it the
                             "standard" way need not upgrade. The new variables
                             will be included in the standard output by next
                             release.
                            Removed the info behind country and date in premiere-
                             info.
                            Added a /diff directory, which will hold .diff files
                             for people who wish to manually upgrade.

- v2.0a - Aug. 01th, 2003 - First (beta) release of the 2.0 version. This is a
                             major upgrade (as in, very different in setup, not
                             in how it works/outputs)
                            Fixed a compatibilty bug with dev. versions of lynx.
                            Fixed a oneline bug re: stats
                            Redid the outputhandling - should take care of
                             malformed output in the .imdb file.
                            Added pidfile - make sure you create this and chmod
                             it 666
                            Moved the config to a separate file.
                            Added support for external channel-formatted output.
                            Added support for external .imdb formatting.
                            Reduced the number of scripts to 2 (instead of 5).

- v1.32 - June 10th, 2003 - Final Final FINAL release. Jeez. I thought I had got
                             rid of all bugs. This one was subtle, but nasty.
                            If your bot becomes unresponsive, or drops out off the
                             channel (timeouts etc), this version might have the
                             fix. Changed all .tcl files, and the main psxc-imdb.sh,
                             so please upgrade. There's a new parameter in the
                             config for you to mess with.

- v1.31 - June  9th, 2003 - Final FINAL release of v1 of this script. There was a
                             bug in psxc-imdb-full.tcl which prevented any output.
                            Also made a minor change in psxc-imdb.sh - no need to
                             upgrade this one if you got a working version (I know
                             it's a bitch redoing all the config).
                            Added more debug info in this file (below).

- v1.3  - May  22nd, 2003 - Final release of v1 of this script, unless some nasty
                             nasty bugs surface. Will be working on v2 from now
                             on. No ETA.
                            Fixed a small bug which occured on some systems that
                             could lead to error messages and 2-3 variables not
                             being shown. Changed some settings in the tcls, to
                             prevent bots from being overworked (I think ;).

- v1.2f - May   8th, 2003 - (not publicly released) Fixed some bugs in the tcls
                             and in psxc-imdb-pre.sh. Added support for f00-pre.

- v1.2e - May   7th, 2003 - Fixed a typo in the new URL file, which prevented
                             it from running in IExplorer.

- v1.2d - May   6th, 2003 - Fixed a bug which prevented *any* output whatsoever
                             to .imdb or channel in certain scenarios.
                            Added support for a separate URL file.

- v1.2c - May   3rd, 2003 - Fixed a bug in the premiere/limited/business
                             lookup. Added support for more than one channel
                             in psxc-imdb-full.tcl.

- v1.2b - May   2nd, 2003 - Added better debug support. Added better handling
                             of failed imdb-lookups.

- v1.2  - Apr. 29th, 2003 - Added support for showing of premiere and limited
                             dates.

- v1.1  - Apr. 28th, 2003 - Fixed another bug with imdb-link extraction.

                             support for showing some opening weekend business
                             data.

- v0.9  - Apr. 28th, 2003 - Added better handling of url extraction. The link
                             must be *really* mangled for the script not to
                             pick it now. Previously it failed if the url
                             started or ended with a char not part of the link.
                            Fixed a bug in psxc-imdb-pre.tcl.

- v0.8  - Apr. 26th, 2003 - Added PRE support. Fixed some bugs in the tcl-
                             scripts - ppl using them are urged to upgrade and
                             .restart the bot.

- v0.7p - Apr. 23rd, 2003 - Not publicly released.

- v0.7  - Apr. 21th, 2003 - Debug support added.
                            Included two small tcl scripts as alternatives
                             to crontab and "normal" botsupport.
                            Changed some output.
                            Added more instructions in README.

- v0.6  - Apr. 13th, 2003 - Small (cosmetic) bugfix in .imdb output.
                            Added support for one-line-only for bot.

- v0.5  - Apr. 13th, 2003 - Added ability to test environment and set up
                             needed files.
                            Added support for backlog of imdb urls.
                            Other changes.
