Made by PnG 2002 GPL (png@rskhq.2y.net)

Well, I didnt see this one comming. I made this little
script for fun, and know it seems like everyone wants it.
What does it do then? Well, it reads the imdb number from
any movie nfo that gets uploaded to your site, and then finds
it on imdb.com and fetches all kind of information and prints
it to your glftpd.log file so your bot can output it in your
site channel!

It looks something like this:

<SiTEBOT> [SiTENAME]-(IMDB) - Snatched some info off IMDB on Lock, Stock... (2000). Directed by: Sheree Folkson (Genre: Drama User Rating: 7.2 / 10  URL: http://us.imdb.com/Title?0243714 ) Plot Outline: Unavailable... 
<SiTEBOT> Business: Lock, Stock... (2000) had a budget of $44m and was filmed in Pinewood Studios, London, England, UK

If you want aditional help with installing or whatever, 
join #getnfoscript on efnet and talk to either me (PnG), 
NiDO or ebzoner. But please, PLEASE read the readme and 
read through all the settings in getnfo.pl. If you are 
lame, dont even bother trying to install this.

.4 FAQ	####
############

Q: When I try to run the script, I get something like "Bad interpreter" or "Couldnt
find that file or directory" Whatdo I do?
A: That means that the script probably cant find perl. Try typing "which perl", if
you get nothing, that means that you will need to install perl, else try typing 
"perl /glftpd/bins/getnfo.pl". If that works, just edit your crontab entry to
look like something like this:
1-59 * * * * perl /glftpd/bin/getnfo.pl 1>/dev/null 2>/dev/null

Q: When I try to run the script, I get something like "Simple.pl is missing". What
do I do?
A: That means that you need to install the LWP package. LWP is a module for perl
that enables it to grab webpages. You can download LWP from www.cpan.org or from
a link on my webpage.

Q: How do I install a perl module?
A: Its accually quite easy.
	1. tar xvfz my_perl_module.tar.gz
	2. cd my_perl_module
	3. perl Makefile.pl
	4. make
	5. make test
	6. READ the output on the screen, here you will findout if some
	thing is missing from your installation.
	6. make install
	7. DONE!

Q: Im lame, and nothing works, what do I do?
A: well, nothing we can do for you, sorry
