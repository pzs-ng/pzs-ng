		- Update ignored_types, removed m3u from it to allow multi-cd m3u's

		- Several other fixes, cleanups and removal of most compiler warnings
		- Fixed another matchpathbug only occuring if a defined path had no trailing /
		- Added a new option audio_artist_sort_various_only which is meant for audioreleases with
		  various artists (VA-/VA_). As every file is now causing a sorting, those releases will be
		  sorted under every artist that appears on them. By setting this option to TRUE, those
		  releases will only be sorted under VA.
		- Sorting of audiofiles now happens for every file opposed to only the last file.
		- Added support for FLAC audiofiles, partially based on the flacpatch by io / yoaha,
		  and made adding other audioformats easier via the new audio_types configuration option.
		  Getting metadata information from other formats than .mp3 and .flac still has to be
		  implemented seperately though.
		  ATTENTION: the following configuration options have changed names due to this:
			del_progressmeter_mp3	>	del_progressmeter_audio

			mp3_script		>	audio_script
			mp3_script_cookies	>	audio_script_cookies
			progressmeter_mp3	>	progressmeter_audio
			realtime_mp3_info	>	realtime_audio_info
		    update your zsconfig.h accordingly.
		  ATTENTION: as the bins will now be compiled against the FLAC libs, you are advised
				to run libcopy.sh after installation, as those external libs have to be
				accessible when chrooted

		  between %t_duration and %u_name and %t_duration and %u_count respectively,

		- Updated sitebot/COOKIES

		  setting in ngBot.conf.defaults

		- Overhaul of the sitebot. RIP dZSbot, hello ngBot.
			- No functionality has been lost.
			- Old configuration files will still work. Rename them to ngBot.conf.
			- Changed the sitebot so it is now in its own namespace. This will break plugins
			  and addons that used the old procs & variables that were in the global
			  namespace. To fix this just prepend ::ngBot:: to the proc/variables.
			  eg: ::ngBot::sndall or ::ngBot::disable.
			- All procs and global variables now reside inside the ::ngBot namespace.
			- Modularised the sitebot so it can now accommodate other ftpds much more easily.
			- Moved a whole heap of glftpd only code into modules/glftpd.tcl.
			- Renamed the prefix of all trigger procs from ng_ to cmd_.
			- Changed the plugin system.
				- Plugins now reside inside the ::ngBot::plugin namespace.
				- The 'init' function within each plugin will be called once all scripts have
				  been loaded. Case sensitive. You should no longer be required to source
				  scripts in a certain order in your eggdrop.conf. ie. NickDb & Blow.
				- The 'deinit' function within each plugin will be called on rehash/restart.
				  No need for each plugin to bind to evnt prerehash anymore. Case sensitive.
				- Within 'init' if you want to return an error and silence the default
				  error message, use: return -code -1.
				- There is an example plugin: plugins/Example.tcl & plugins/Example.zpt.
				- Updated all plugins in the plugins/ directory to incorporate the all
				  changes.
			- Added an example ftpd module: modules/example.tcl.
			- All binds bound to a proc matching ::ngBot::* will now be unbound on
			  rehash/reset. No need to unbind them in plugins anymore.
			- It now now technically possible to run 2 or more sitebots on the one eggdrop
			  with some small modifications.
		- Updated psxc-trailer to 0.6 - no feature added, only some checks for dir-
		  perms.
		- added rescan_script and enable_rescan_script option to run script on rescan
		  if the release is complete.
		- change libcopy to better handle resolving in chroot environment (Debian and
		  Ubuntu in particular need this fix)
		- make dl_speedtest output to .debug

v1.1.0a --> 1.2.0 :
		- added option to make accept_script run prior to complete_script.
		- fix in tv-rage tcl to compensate for layout changes.

		  mp3-releases. Thanks goes to |DureX| for report and fix.

                - we no longer manually add spaces between racers in sortstats()/racer_list,
                  so racersplit is now per default " ". Neither do we add a space after
                  racersplit_prior.
                - renamed racersplit_prior to racersplit_prefix, and removed it from conf 
                  (it's been deprecated for a while).
                - removed racersplit & racersmsg from conf. (it's been deprecated for a while)
                - added racersplit_postfix.
                - %T/%t now users racersplit* too.

		   This sorts a dir based on the same critera as rescan/zipscript does,
		   but does not require a completed release (or even a release at all,
		   could be used for non-zipscripted sites).
		   In addition, sorting now deletes any other identically named links,
		   and puts the 'right' one in place of it. :)

v0.6.1	--> 1.0.0  : The changes from the original project-zs by d1 is
			significant. There is nearly no code that has not been
			changed. For a full list of new/changed options, i
			suggest you read README.ZSCONFIG for the zipscript, and
			look at the README for the sitebot. Sitewho has also
			changed a lot and have been given a few new options, so
			check the sitebot.conf and the README.

			In total, there has been over 1800 code updates, so
			i won't list all of those here. I'll just list what
			changes are major ones. The new config options listed
			below can be read about in README.ZSCONFIG.

			codechanges not directly related to config options:
			---------------------------------------------------
			- glftpd v1.xx and 2.xx supported.
			- the 4GB limit has been removed.
			- max number of files in a release has been changed from 100 to 1024 - this limit can easily be changed later.
			- support for sections added.
			- the shared memory dependency has been removed. This means that it will work on any glftpd version, or other ftpd.
			- some cookies has changed, others removed or added.
			- output to glftpd.log is no longer user-formatted - instead raw cookies are logged.
			- major rewrites removed all known memory leaks and possible core reasons.
			- debug output is vastly improved.
			- mp3 vbr support is added.
			- portability has improved - the most popular platforms are supported.
			- partial amd64-support - you need to compile in m32 mode, but the zipscript works.
			- smart handling of double sfv make sure a false sfv isn't uploaded.
			- improved handling of sfv content.
			- a locking mechanism is added, which prevent race conditions and wrongly marked incomplete releases.
			- the crc table was replaced with a better/correct one, which helps on large file releases.
			- all bins are changed to run under chroot only.
			- cleanup now removes broken links and lists incomplete releases
			- compile options like --with-ss5 give ss5 support.
			- the zipscript will calculate the crc of the file if no crc (0) is sent from glftpd.
			- cleanup now works as a cscript to 'site nuke' and 'site wipe'
			- datacleaner now works as a cscript to 'RMD' and 'site nuke'
			- a banned (mp3)-release can be deleted automatically after first file, saving bw and hd-space.
			- ng-chown (a new bin) allows you to chown files/dirs. An example of its use is included.
			- ng-undupe (a new bin) will undupe files that fail (on rescan for instance) allowing the file to be re-uploaded.
			- upgrading is easy - there is no need to rewrite the config for each upgrade - just copy it over.
			- zsconfig.h now only holds changes to the defaults, ie on upgrades new options will be used with default values.
			- the zipscript can be run from (chroot'ed) shell, allowing for easier debugging (and execution from scripts).
			- rescan is "safe" - it will not remove files that are being uploaded.


		----	Changes in the sitebot:

			Numerous new IRC commands: !leechers, !idlers, !uploaders,
			!new, !nukes, !unnukes, !search, and !uptime.

			A new plug-in system, which makes it easier for users to
			add custom features without having to directly modify the
			source files. There are several example plug-ins included;
			such as a pre-time check, channel kick on deluser, and
			an IRC nick to FTP user mapping plug-in.

			Invite users to private channels based on their name,
			group, or flags. For example, one could invite all
			users with the "1" flag to #Staff.

			dZSbot can announce sysop.log and login.log events, or
			redirect them to your staff channel.

			The FTP bouncer check now supports explicit secure connections,
			commonly referred to as "AUTH TLS".

			The bot now uses a theming system to customize channel
			announces. A preview system is included allowing you
			to view your theme before using it.

			Easier configuration - if an option isn't defined the
			default value will be used. This makes upgrading much easier,
			since there's no need to reconfigure the bot for each update.

			Full support for glftpd v1.x and v2.x.

			Better error control - instead of crashing, the bot
			will output what's wrong in the party line.


		----	Changes in sitebot scripts/addons:

			A few new scripts have been added.

			Some scripts have been revised, others rewritten.


		----	Changes in sitewho:

			A lot of the code have been rewritten.

			A few new options have been added.

			Full support for glftpd v1.x and v2.x.


		----	Changes in scripts/:

			A few scripts have been removed, other added and some
			revised/rewritten/replaced.
