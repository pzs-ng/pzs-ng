    ZSCONFIG.H - A GUIDE
    ---------------------

    zsconfig.h can include a number of options. Starting with pzs-ng beta 4, the
    settings in zsconfig.h are overrides, meaning that not all of these settings
    need be in zsconfig.h. Only the ones you change should be put there.
    This provide a very flexible configuration, and upgrades should be less of a
    hassle, since new settings in the config is no longer a concern - they will
    be used with default settings.

    Here follow a summary of all settings. I hope this will provide some idea on
    what the different things does. The format is as follow:

    <define> <option(s)>
            Description
            Default: <value>

    To add a define, for instance sitepath_dir, put the following in you zsconfig.h

    #define sitepath_dir	"/mysite/"

    ie, add '#define" in front, and the option(s) behind.

        comment: |-
            This is the place(s) where your site's groups/affilliates have space
            provided. Normally each (release-)group have a designated area
            accessible only to the group's members, in which they upload a new
            release and 'pre' it (release it) simultanously on several sites.
            Uploads and races in these dirs will not be logged. Dirs are separated
            with the space character.
        default: '"/site/groups/"'

    zip_dirs:
        type: paths
        comment: |-
            This variable should hold a list of dirs where you expect zip-releases.
            Dirs listed here will be logged. Dirs are separated by a space
            character.
        default: '"/site/test/ /site/incoming/0day/"'

    sfv_dirs:

        comment: |-
            Similar to zip_dirs, this holds a list of dirs you expect to get sfv-
            releases. Typical releases that use sfv is anything that is not zipped,
            like rar, mp3, avi etc. Dirs listed here will be logged. Dirs are
            separated by a space character.

        comment: |-
            Normally dirs in group/zip/sfv dirs are checked for corruption and
            completeness. The dirs listed in this varaible will override paths
            inside the previous dirs, and not check the files uploaded.
            Unlike the original zipscript-c, pzs-ng will only check dirs listed
            in group/zip/sfv dirs, and not the entire site. Dirs are separated
            by a space character.
        default: '"/site/private/"'

    noforce_sfv_first_dirs:
        type: paths
        comment: |-
            The option 'force_sfv_first' forces sfv to be uploaded first in a
            release. In some dirs, this may not be desiarable. To the rescue come
            this option, which allow you to enter dirs that will be excluded from
            the force.
        default: '"/site/incoming/requests/"'

    speedtest_dirs:
        type: paths
        comment: |-
            On sites it is common with special dirs dedicated to speedtesting. You
            can define here the dirs dedicated to speedtesting.
        default: '"/site/speedtest/"'

    speedtest_delfile:
        type: boolean
        comment: |-
            With speedtest you can choose if you wish to keep the uploaded files or
            remove them immediatly. If you choose to keep them, the files will be
            renamed to xx.xMiB
        default: false

    use_partial_on_noforce:
        type: boolean
        comment: |-
            Usually all pathmatches are full paths. You can change this on what
            you put in noforce_sfv_first_dirs to make it match parts of a dir,
            like 'sample' or something. Please be careful to include a slash after
            the dirs if this setting is on - like '/sample/', to minimize the
            number of possible wrong hits.
        default: false

    spaces_to_dots:
        type: boolean
        comment: |-
            This option will replace spaces in audio-genre dirs to dots.
        default: false

    audio_nocheck_dirs:

        comment: |-
            Audio-files can be checked against a list of allowed/denied genres,
            years etc. Audio-files found in paths defined in this variable will
            not be checked against these defines, thus allowing them. Dirs are
            separated by a space character.
        default: '"/site/groups/ /site/incoming/requests/"'

    audio_nosort_dirs:
        type: paths
        comment: |-
            If you do not want to sort the audio-files in certain dirs (but still
            want to check for validity and announce them in chan) you can define a
            list of dirs in this variable.
        default: '"/site/incoming/requests/"'

    rescan_nocheck_dirs_allowed:
        type: boolean
        comment: |-
            If you need to check a dir placed in a nocheck_dirs area, you must
            set this variable to TRUE. Setting this to FALSE will render the rescan
            option dead in nocheck_dirs areas.
        default: true

    rescan_default_to_quick:
        type: boolean
        comment: |-
            This option sets the default mode for rescan regarding the quick mode.
            In quick mode only the files not already marked as good will be
            rescanned. This is good if some files are uploaded, but not checked by
            the zipscript.
        default: true

    strict_path_match:
        type: boolean
        comment: |-
            This setting is used to enforce the filetype (zip/sfv) based on path.
            When set to TRUE, zip files is not allowed in sfv dirs, and the other
            way around. group dirs are not affected, as they can be both.
        default: false

    sfv_calc_single_fname:
        type: boolean
        comment: |-
            Setting this to TRUE enables the zipscript to calculate a crc checksum
            for filenames listed in the sfv, which do not have a corresponding crc.
            Normally only broken sfv's should have a missing crc after a filename.
        default: false

    subdir_list:
        type: string
        comment: |-
            This is a list of what is defined as subdirs. Dirs matching these
            patterns will be considered subdirs, and follow a different pattern
            regarding symlinks and nfo-rules etc.
            Put the char '?' where a number or char may or may not be, but *only*
            at the end of a dirname. Ie, cd?? will match cdA, cd12, but not cd123.
            Do not put '?' at the beginning or in the middle - it will not work.
            The string is not case-sensitive (dVd == DvD).
        default: '"cd??,disc??,disk??,dvd??,extra?,sub?,subtitle?,vobsub?,sample?,subpack?,ac3,audioaddon,addon,ac3addon,proof,cover?"'

    sample_list:
        type: string
        comment: |-
            This is a comma-seperated list of sample-dirs. The list is not case-sensitive.

    gl_sections:
        type: string
        comment: |-
            Here you should put a list of all sections on your site. Sections is
            not the same as dirs, but is what you have defined as sections in
            glftpd.conf. See glftpd's docs for more info on sections.
            First section is normally named 'DEFAULT'. The order in which you put
            the names of the sections are important. Separate sections with a
            space character.
        default: '"DEFAULT"'

    short_sitename:
        type: string
        comment: |-
            Insert here the name of your site, short format. This will be used on

        default: '"NG"'

    allowed_types_exemption_dirs:
        type: paths
        comment: |-
            In allowed_types we define filetypes that are allowed on site w/o
            any checks. Define here paths where these filetypes should be checked
            *if* an sfv is uploaded.
        default: '"/site/incoming/musicvideos/"'

    check_for_missing_nfo_dirs:
        type: paths
        comment: |-
            Normally each release has a .nfo included. It has info about the
            release written by the release-group, and may contain vital info
            like serials etc. The paths defined in this value will be checked
            for missing nfo after the release is marked as 'complete'. Separate
            dirs with a space character.
        default: '"/site/incoming/games/ /site/incoming/apps/"'

    create_missing_sfv_link:
        type: boolean
        comment: |-
            normally releases have a sfv, unless they are zip releases. This

        default: true

    create_incomplete_links_in_group_dirs:
        type: boolean
        comment: |-
            Should incomplete indicators be created in groupdirs? With the default
            settings this should be no problem, but if you change the location of
            the links, it may very well be.
        default: true

    check_for_missing_sample_dirs:
        type: paths
        comment: |-
            Each movie-release should have a sample included, to show quality.
            The paths defined in this value will be checked for missing samples.
            Separate dirs with a space character.
        default: '"/site/incoming/movies/"'

        comment: |-
            List of characters that can be around the strings listed in
            missing_sample_check_ignore_list. Leave this empty if you want to
            match parts of dirnames without them being surrounded.
            This list is casesensitive.
            Example: With "proof" in missing_sample_check_ignore_list,
            Proof.Of.Concept-GRP would only be matched if
            missing_sample_check_ignore_dividers is empty.

        comment: |-
            If a dirname under the paths listed in check_for_missing_sample_dirs
            has any of the strings in this list, then a sample is not required
            and no incomplete_sample_indicator is created.
            Every string is checked to be surrounded by the chars in
            missing_sample_check_ignore_dividers. This implies that the first and
            last character of a dirname are never checked as part of a listed
            string, unless missing_sample_check_ignore_dividers is empty.
            Separate strings with a comma character. List is not casesensitive.
        default: '"dirfix,fix,freezefix,fullsubpack,nfofix,proof,rarfix,subfix,subpack,subpck,syncfix"'

    max_seconds_wait_for_lock:

        comment: |-
            This number representents the maximum number of seconds a process will
            wait for a lock on release. Usually only a second or two will actually
            be used, since the only program using time by default is rescan, and it
            has a low priority, which the other processes will provide a signal to
            quit.
            Anyway, not something you should worry too much about, unless your site
            usually holds files in the 100MB area on a slow/busy server that're
            rescanned on a regular basis.

    lock_optimize:

        comment: |-
            This option is meant to minimize impact the runtime of the locking.
            The number represents the number of seconds that must pass before the
            lock is touched/updated. Usually, this is either set to 1 or 0.
            0 disable this feature.

        comment: |-
            If a lock cannot be obtained within the time set in
            max_seconds_wait_for_lock, the zipscript will usually exit with an
            error. You can, however, bypass this so it checks the file as normal.
            This can lead to race-conditions, however, so it's set to FALSE by
            default. Usually such conditions should *never* occur, but may in
            rare conditions, especially if 3rd party scripts/addons are being
            used.

            You can ban certain files on site, based on name. The check is not

            want on your site.
            For more info, or upgraded lists, see http://project-sl.swecheck.net
            Please note - chars like [ and ] are used in the wildcard scheme - if you
            search for such chars in the filenames, you need to double-escape them,
            ie \\[ and \\] and \\( etc.
