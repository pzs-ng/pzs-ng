--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 1. Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  a) Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Copy the necessary files to your Eggdrop's directory:
  mkdir -p /path/to/eggdrop/pzs-ng/themes
  cp -R ngBot.* plugins themes modules /path/to/eggdrop/pzs-ng/

 - On a new install (not upgrade):
  cp ngBot.conf.dist /path/to/eggdrop/pzs-ng/ngBot.conf

 - Edit the configuration file (ngBot.conf) to your liking.

 - If you want the bouncer checker, you must install a recent version of cURL.
 cURL supports secure FTP connections (AUTH TLS), this feature is only available
 if cURL is compiled with SSL support. Check cURL's version for more information.

 $ curl --version
 curl 7.12.3 (i386-portbld-freebsd4.11) libcurl/7.12.3 OpenSSL/0.9.7d zlib/1.1.4
 Protocols: ftp gopher telnet dict ldap http file https ftps
 Features: IPv6 Largefile NTLM SSL libz

 - If "ftps" is not listed in protocols and "SSL" is not listed in features, you
 must disable the secure BNC option, (set bnc(SECURE) FALSE). Alternatively, you
 could recompile cURL with SSL support, it's your choice.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  b) Compiling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - The "src" directory contains helper scripts used by ngBot. These binaries compiled
 from root makefile. However, you can always compile them separately by issuing
 "make" and "make install" inside this the directory.

 glwho            - An experimental Tcl extension for glftpd online stats.

 passchk          - Used by !invite to authenticate users (requires OpenSSL headers).

 showlog          - Displays the latest entries in the dirlog and nukelog for
                    external scripts (used by ngBot for !new/!search/!nukes/!unnukes).

 - The "extra" directory contains helper scripts to be used with the sitebot.

 fakelog.sh       - Use this to simulate log entries.

 incomplete-list.sh The bot can show a list of incompletes for each section
                    defined in the actual script. (remember to edit sections)

 invite.sh        - This is used with custom command "site invite".
                    Add the following to glftpd.conf:
                    site_cmd        INVITE  EXEC    /bin/invite.sh
                    custom-invite   !8 *

 top.tcl          - Display the weekly top uploaders.
                    Add the following to eggdrop.conf:
                    source scripts/top.tcl

 - The "plugins" directory contains useful plug-ins for ngBot. Refer to
 [plugins/README](plugins/README) for more information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  c) Loading the sitebot
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Eggdrop must be linked against Tcl v8.4 (or newer). ngBot uses certain
 functions which are not present in previous versions of Tcl.

 - Load ngBot as you would load any Eggdrop script, by adding the following line
 to your eggdrop.conf:
 source pzs-ng/ngBot.tcl

 - Rehash or restart your Eggdrop for the changes to take effect.

 - When updating ngBot to a newer revision, refer to the sitebot/UPDATING file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 2. Themes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  a) Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - To install a theme - all you need to do is edit ngBot.conf and change a line:
 set announce(THEMEFILE) "yourtheme.zst"

 - ngBot will look for the theme in its own path by default. However, you may
 specify the full path if you prefer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  b) Bundled themes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - The following themes are bundled with pzs-ng:

 default.zst - This is not an attractive theme, nor is it meant to be. This
               theme should be used a reference when creating a new theme or
               updating your existing one.

 classic.zst - A simple theme, based on the dZSbot and project-zs look.

 dakrer.zst  - Similar to default.zst but with less output and a (small) splash of
               colors. See theme for additional info. Created and maintained by dakrer.

 vampire.zst - juanker's colorful theme.

 psxc.zst    - psxc's go at a theme. Minimalistic, with minimal colors.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  c) Special theme settings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Some theme settings may seem unusual, one in particular is the *_LOOP# variables
 seen in the script.

 - Some announce events format the output for several users; like the nukees during
 NUKE and UNNUKE, and the user top when a race completes.

 - In order to customize such an announce, we have to format each user or group
 individually. This is accomplished through the %loop# variables in the theme,
 which will be replaced with the corresponding _LOOP# theme.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  d) Customizing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Feel free to edit and customize any of the bundled themes, but it is advised
 to create a copy of it first. For example: "cp default.zst mytheme.zst"

 - You can preview your theme while editing it, using the .preview DCC command
 added in 1.0 beta5. Type .preview in a DCC chat session with your Eggdrop for more
 information.

 - Using colors is fairly simple in ngBot. Simply define a color in the theme:

 COLOR1 = "04"
 ..
 COLOR3 = "07"

 - The color can be referenced in the theme file by doing:

 announce.SOMETHING = "[%c3{%section}] %c2{Something happened} in %c1{%pf}"

 - Color table:

 00 - White                 08 - Yellow
 01 - Black                 09 - Light green
 02 - Blue                  10 - Cyan
 03 - Green                 11 - Light cyan
 04 - Light red             12 - Light blue
 05 - Red                   13 - Light magenta
 06 - Magenta (purple)      14 - Gray
 07 - Orange (dark yellow)  15 - Light gray

 - NOTE: ngBot only supports 3 user defined colors per theme.

 - Starting with 1.0 beta4 of pzs-ng, you can define custom colors for each section.
 To use this feature, this you must define colors in the theme for the specific
 section. The section name must be the exact same as the one defined in ngBot.conf,
 and you must define the same number of section colors as in your default scheme.

 - If you have 3 default colors (COLOR1, COLOR2, and COLOR3), then if you
 want a custom color scheme for your GAMES section you need to add the following to
 your theme file:

 COLOR_GAMES_1 = "ww"
 COLOR_GAMES_2 = "xx"
 COLOR_GAMES_3 = "yy"

 - Another new addition to pzs-ng 1.0 beta4 is the ability to add padding/justifying
 control codes to the theme. You can select left or right justification, and the
 number of spaces to pad the string to. %r = right-justified text, %l = left-
 justified text, %m = centered text.

 In theme                         Output
 --------                         ------
 XtestX                           XtestX
 X%l9{test}X                      Xtest     X
 X%r9{test}X                      X     testX
 X%m9{test}X                      X  test   X
